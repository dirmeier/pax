Ramsey documentation
====================

Ramsey is a library for probabilistic modelling using `Haiku <https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku>`_ and `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_.
It builds upon the same module system that Haiku is using  and is hence fully compatible with Haiku's, NumPyro's API.
Ramsey implements (or rather intends to implement) neural and Gaussian process models, normalizing flows,
and diffusion and score-based models.

.. code-block:: python

    import haiku as hk
    import jax.random as random
    from ramsey.data import sample_from_sinus_function
    from ramsey.models import NP

    def neural_process(**kwargs):
        dim = 128
        np = NP(
            decoder=hk.nets.MLP([dim] * 3 + [2]),
            latent_encoder=(
                hk.nets.MLP([dim] * 3), hk.nets.MLP([dim, dim * 2])
            )
        )
        return np(**kwargs)

    (x, y), _ = sample_from_sinus_function(random.PRNGKey(0))

    neural_process = hk.transform(neural_process)
    params = neural_process.init(
        random.PRNGKey(1), x_context=x, y_context=y, x_target=x
    )


Why Ramsey
----------

Just as the names of other probabilistic languages are inspired by researchers in the field
(e.g., Stan, Edward, Turing), Ramsey takes its name from one of my favourite philosophers/mathematicians,
`Frank Ramsey <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey/>`_.

Installation
------------

To install from PyPI, call:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ramsey

To install the latest GitHub <RELEASE>, just call the following on the
command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/dirmeier/ramsey@<RELEASE>

See also the installation instructions for `Haiku <https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku>`_ and `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_, if
you plan to use Ramsey on GPU/TPU.

Contributing
------------

Contributions in the form of pull requests are more than welcome. A good way to start is to check out issues labelled
`"good first issue" <https://github.com/ramsey-devs/ramsey/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_.

In order to contribute:

1) Install Ramsey and dev dependencies via :code:`pip install -e '.[dev]'`,
2) test your contribution/implementation by calling :code:`tox` on the (Unix) command line before submitting a PR.
