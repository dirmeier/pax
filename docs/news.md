*Latest news on the development of Ramsey.*

----

.. note::

    With :code:`Haiku` having gone into a maintenance mode after the merger of Google Brain and Deepmind,
    Ramsey will now be using :code:`Flax` as default neural network library.
    Starting from version :code:`v0.2.0` all :code:`Haiku` code will be replaced with :code:`Flax` code. Sadge.

.. note::

    Starting from version :code:`v0.2.0` on, experimental and possibly non-permant code will be put into submodule :code:`ramsey.experimental`.
    Hence you can expect that the main code base won't change or be subject to API breaking changes, while the experimental code possibly can or even get
    deleted in the future.
